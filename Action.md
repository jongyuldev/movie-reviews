## Superman 2025
The movie conveyed a strong message about looking out for and caring for others, creating a very welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. I find that modern action movies often lack messages that strongly emphasize the joy of helping others, no matter the scale—even in the smallest of ways. While the development of the relationship between Superman and Lois felt a bit cliché, it was still enjoyable to watch. The plot itself was somewhat predictable throughout, but I personally appreciate straightforward stories that effectively deliver the director's intended emotional resonance. Overall, a nice movie!
