## La La Land (2016)
"This movie is a horror movie." That's a running joke I've come across countless times whenever I've seen clips of this movie on Instagram Reels. I always wondered why people called it that, despite it not being tagged as a horror, so I finally checked it out.

And oh my... I understood what they meant. It was an absolute "jumpscare" to learn that the two main characters go through all those relationship issues and, in the end, don't even end up together.

The movie itself is wonderful. From the storytelling to the cinematography, from the music to the ambience, I loved nearly every single moment of it.

The only thing that was a bit weird to me was Mia's situation. It felt like she _technically_ cheated on her boyfriend but _technically_ didn't at the same time. Meeting Sebastian before officially breaking up with her boyfriend was questionable, but she did eventually end that relationship and decide to meet Seb instead, so I was cool with that. But seriously, otherwise, the movie was so good!
